GETTING STARTED</h1>
<p class="western">Vital Signs is an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=alexa+skills" target="_blank">Alexa
skill</a> that maintains a history of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs" target="_blank">primary
vital signs</a> – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and body
temperature – and emails you a file and chart of this data whenever
you request it. To use Vital Signs, do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p class="western">First, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Skill-to-Alexa" target="_blank">enable
	the skill</a> on your Echo device</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Second, grant the skill permission to
	access your first name and the email address associated with your
	Amazon account. Vital Signs uses these to communicate with you
	during various skill interactions. To assign permissions, open the
	Alexa app – or login to <a href="https://alexa.amazon.com/" target="_blank">alexa.amazon.com</a>
	– then select: Skills &gt; Your Skills &gt; Vital Signs &gt;
	Settings &gt; Manage Permissions, and turn on the requested options.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Finally, ask Alexa to “open Vital Signs”,
	and create your account.</p>
</ol>

PROXIES</h1>
<p class="western">We’ve all been in situations where we’d like
to know how someone is doing, but we can’t be around to check on
them. The Vital Signs proxy feature is meant to handle this. Let’s
say Mary is currently a Vital Signs user, and John – Mary’s son –
would like to access Mary’s data. Here’s how John (with Mary’s
permission) can do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p class="western">First, John needs to create his own Vital
	Signs account. John may not be interested in recording/tracking his
	own vital signs, but he still needs to have an account if he wants
	to read his mom’s data.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Next, Mary needs to give John permission to
	access her data, i.e. she must designate John as a proxy. To do
	this, Mary opens Vital Signs, and tells the assistant she wants to
	update her proxy info. The skill then sends Mary an email message
	that lists her current proxies, and gives instructions for sending a
	reply that adds (or deletes) a proxy on her account. Mary then
	submits a reply adding John as a proxy. Afterwards, Mary can ask
	Vital Signs to resend her proxy info, so she can confirm that John
	has been added to her proxy list.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Lastly, once John has been named as Mary’s
	proxy, then whenever he asks Vital Signs to send a report, the skill
	will send John both his own data, as well has his mom’s.</p>
</ol>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-left: 0.49in"><img src="VitalSigns_html_4b4d89bb2854b70b.png" name="Image3" align="bottom" width="414" height="344" border="0"/>
</p>
<p class="western">There is no limit on the number of proxies a user
can associate with his/her account. Thus, for example, if Mary had
other children she could make all of them proxies. Similarly, there
is no restriction on the number of times a single user can be named
as a proxy for someone else. So, for example, if John also wants to
keep tabs on his dad, Jim, then Jim can also name John as a proxy on
his (Jim’s) account.</p>

</p>
<h1 class="western">BACKGROUND</h1>
<p class="western">I’ve been interested in math and computer
science ever since earning degrees in these fields almost 40 years
ago. Later, I acquired an interest in medicine after being diagnosed
with a condition called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer" target="_blank">Lynch
Syndrome</a>” which predisposes me to a whole assortment of
cancers. Vital Signs is my attempt to integrate all of these diverse
interests in the development of a modern voice assistant skill.</p>
<p class="western">Those of us who’ve been diagnosed with any sort
of chronic medical condition like to keep close tabs on our health,
and stay on the lookout for early warning signs of disease. Most
diagnostic tests require a doctor’s prescription, so they’re not
directly accessible to patients. Hence, patients like myself try to
make best use of tests and data that <i>is</i> within our reach. This
data is generally termed “<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/scientific-initiatives/patient-generated-health-data" target="_blank">Patient-Generated
Health Data (PGHD)</a>”. Unfortunately, health metrics that are
readily available to patients oftentimes aren’t the most sensitive
or specific indicators of complex disease. It is my hope and belief,
however, that <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/hype-reality-artificial-intelligence-ai-transform-health-healthcare" target="_blank">advances
in artificial intelligence/machine learning</a> (AI/ML) may start to
change this, as new insights are gleaned from data that had
previously been under analyzed. 
</p>
<p class="western">Not everyone may share my enthusiasm for tracking
health data. What potion of the population are interested in
collecting and recording their health data? What are the best metrics
to collect? Is voice assistant technology the right platform for
this? If people do embrace voice assistants for this purpose, how
well will they adhere to a regular reporting schedule? These are all
questions that Vital Signs may help to answer.</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="PRIVACY_STATEMENT"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc119_562478963"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc119_1211803896"></a>
PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
<p class="western">This privacy notice applies to the Vital Signs
Alexa skill. In general it covers:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">What personally identifiable information
	(PII) is collected while using the skill, how it is used, and with
	whom it is shared.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The security controls in place to protect
	your information.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">How you can administer your information.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Information Collection &amp; Sharing 
</h2>
<p class="western">Vital Signs is intended for personal use. The
information you share with the skill – your first name, email
address, and vital sign data – is not sold or otherwise shared with
any commercial entity. Only you, your designated proxies, and myself
(as system administrator) have access to the data.</p>
<h2 class="western">Information Security Controls</h2>
<p class="western">A variety of security controls have been
implemented to protect your data:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Your vital sign information is stored on a
	virtual private server (VPS) that is physically hosted and secured
	by Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The Vital Signs account on the VPS is
	locked down so it is only accessible to the system administrator
	(me).</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Your name and email address are stored as
	clear text on the server, but your vital sign history file is
	encrypted on disk using the Linux <a href="http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/">ccrypt</a>
	utility. The encryption key is not stored locally, but is passed to
	the server by the Alexa skill.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Whenever your data is transmitted across a
	network (e.g. during HTTP and SMTP sessions), it is encrypted using
	TLS.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The skill uses gmail to send/receive email.
	All email folders associated with the administrator account are
	purged daily.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Managing Your Data</h2>
<p class="western">If at any time you’d like to remove your
information from the system, simply ask the skill to erase your data,
which removes just your history file, or to delete your account,
which removes everything about you: your name, email address, and
vital sign history.</p>
<h2 class="western">What about HIPAA?</h2>
<p class="western">It’s worth saying a word about HIPAA. HIPAA
stands for the “Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act”. It’s a law passed back in 1996 that mandates certain data
privacy and security provisions to safeguard medical information.
Does HIPAA apply to information that a patient submits to a health
app like Vital Signs, and if so, how? Thankfully, the Department of
Health and Human services has already considered this scenario, and
<a href="https://hipaaqsportal.hhs.gov/community-library/accounts/92/925889/Public/OCR-health-app-developer-scenarios-2-2016.pdf" target="_blank">published
guidelines on their website</a> to assist app developers. According
to those guidelines, the Vital Signs skill is not subject to HIPAA
regulations. Here’s an excerpt from the guidelines:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.49in">Scenario:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.98in">Consumer downloads a
health app to her smartphone. She populates it with her own
information. For example, the consumer inputs blood glucose levels
and blood pressure readings she obtained herself using home health
equipment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.49in">Based on the Facts
Presented in the Scenario, Is App Developer a HIPAA Business
Associate?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.98in">No. Developer is not
creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health
information (PHI) on behalf of a covered entity or another business
associate. The consumer is using the developer’s app to help her
manage and organize her information without any involvement of her
health care providers.</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc128_3748293789"></a>FEEDBACK</h1>
<p class="western">I’d appreciate your feedback on the skill. Feel
free to email me your comments at welbydx@gmail.com.</p>
