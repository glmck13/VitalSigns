<p class="western">Vital Signs (a.k.a. “Welby’s” Vital Signs on
Google) is a voice assistant app currently available on both the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S5KN6K6">Alexa</a> and <a href="https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000b41a84c96c">Google</a>
platforms that assists users in collecting, analyzing, and sharing
health metrics with caregivers. I was inspired to develop the app
during my participation in the “<a href="https://www.pcori.org/research-results/2018/patients-assigned-research-teams-nurses-and-er-providers-enhance-diagnosis">PARTNERED</a>”
research project at Johns Hopkins, which just recently concluded.
Vital Signs enables patients like myself to track our <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/scientific-initiatives/patient-generated-health-data">PGHD</a>
(Patient Generated Health Data), have the data analyzed by smart
“bots”, and share results with caregivers.</p>
<p class="western">Vital Signs is designed to be customizable, so
that it can be easily adapted to different use cases. By default,
Vital Signs records the four primary vital signs: body temperature,
respiration rate, pulse, and blood pressure, but the app can be
modified to collect any set of health metrics simply by emailing
welbydx@gmail.com a new voice script that specifies what data to
collect. In the same fashion, the app can be tailored with
user-defined “webhooks” to integrate custom techniques for
analyzing and plotting the data.</p>
<h1 class="western">GETTING STARTED</h1>
<p class="western">To get started with Vital Signs, do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="western">First, for Amazon devices, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Skill-to-Alexa">follow
	these instructions to enable the skill</a> (there’s no need to do
	this on Google)</p>
	<li><p class="western">Second, grant the skill/action permission to
	access your first name and the email address associated with your
	Amazon/Google account. Vital Signs uses these to communicate with
	you during various dialogue interactions.</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western">For Alexa devices, open the Alexa app – or
		login to <a href="https://alexa.amazon.com/" target="_blank">alexa.amazon.com</a>
		– then select: Skills &gt; Your Skills &gt; Vital Signs &gt;
		Settings &gt; Manage Permissions, and turn on the requested
		options.</p>
		<li><p class="western">For Google devices, the action will talk you
		through the steps to link your account.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li><p class="western">Finally, ask Alexa/Google to “Talk to
	(Welby’s) Vital Signs”, and create your account.</p>
</ol>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc120_3748293789"></a><a name="PROXIES"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc113_1211803896"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc113_562478963"></a>
PROXIES</h1>
<p class="western">We’ve all been in situations where we’d like
to know how someone is doing, but we can’t be around to check on
them. The Vital Signs proxy feature is designed to handle this. Let’s
say Mary is currently a Vital Signs user, and John – Mary’s son –
would like to access Mary’s data. Here’s how John (with Mary’s
permission) can do this:</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-left: 0.5in"><img src="VitalSigns_html_4b4d89bb2854b70b.png" name="Image2" align="middle" width="433" height="347" border="0"/>
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="western">First, John needs to create his own Vital
	Signs account. John may not be interested in recording/tracking his
	own vital signs, but he still needs to have an account if he wants
	to read his mom’s data.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Next, Mary needs to give John permission to
	access her data, i.e. she must designate John as a proxy. To do
	this, Mary opens Vital Signs, and tells the assistant she wants to
	update her proxy info. The tool then sends Mary an email message
	that lists her current proxies, and gives instructions for sending a
	reply that adds (or deletes) a proxy on her account. Mary then
	submits a reply adding John as a proxy. Afterwards, Mary can ask
	Vital Signs to resend her proxy info, so she can confirm that John
	has been added to her proxy list.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Lastly, once John has been named as Mary’s
	proxy, then whenever he asks Vital Signs to send a report, the tool
	will send John both his own data, as well has his mom’s.</p>
</ol>
<p class="western">There is no limit on the number of proxies a user
can associate with his/her account. Thus, for example, if Mary had
other children she could make all of them proxies. Similarly, there
is no restriction on the number of times a single user can be named
as a proxy for someone else. So, for example, if John also wants to
keep tabs on his dad, Jim, then Jim can also name John as a proxy on
his (Jim’s) account.</p>
<h1 class="western">CUSTOMIZING The APP</h1>
<p class="western">When you enter data into Vital Signs, the tool
follows a script to prompt for input. Here’s the default script:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.79in">What is your
&quot;temperature&quot;, in degrees Fahrenheit?<br/>
What is your
&quot;respiration rate&quot;, in breaths per minute?<br/>
What is
your &quot;pulse&quot;, in beats per minute?<br/>
What is your &quot;blood
pressure&quot;?<br/>
#Temperature,Respiration,Pulse,Systolic,Diastolic</p>
<p class="western">Vital Signs uses the words enclosed “in quotes”
to build the confirmation message after you enter all of your data.
Those words are also used as the column headings in your report.csv
file, unless you supply a specific header line (beginning with “#”)
at the end of the script.</p>
<p class="western">In order to replace the default script with one of
your own, simply send an email to <a href="mailto:welbydx@gmail.com">welbydx@gmail.com</a>
with the word “script” somewhere in the subject line. For
example, here’s an email that changes the script to one that tracks
your current weight and how many calories you’ve eaten:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.79in">From:
<a href="mailto:Mary@xmail.com">Mary@xmail.com</a><br/>
To:
<a href="mailto:welbydx@gmail.com">welbydx@gmail.com</a><br/>
Subject:
New vital signs script</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.79in">What is your &quot;weight&quot;,
in pounds?<br/>
How many “calories” have you consumed?</p>
<p class="western">Data values can be numbers (with or without
decimals), names, or yes/no responses. When appropriate, a data value
can be left blank by responding “skip”, “blank”, “empty”,
or “null” when prompted for input.</p>
<p class="western">For users who want to customize how their data is
plotted &amp; analyzed, they can specify their own webhooks (URLs)
for each of these functions.  The “send report” command generates
plots by submitting the user’s report.csv data to a webhook. The
app passes the csv file as raw HTTP POST data (not a multipart
form!), and expects an image/png in return. The default webhook for
generating plots is posted on the
<a href="https://github.com/glmck13/VitalSigns/blob/master/plot.cgi">
Vital Signs github site</a>.
Users can replace the default webhook with one
of their own simply by sending an email to welbydx@gmail.com with the
word “plot” somewhere in the subject line, and then including the
webhook URL in the body of the message.  The “analyze data”
command also employs a webhook to process the csv data. The default
URL can be replaced in the same manner as indicated above for custom
plots, i.e. by sending an email to welbydx@gmail.com with the word
“analyze” somewhere the subject line, and entering the URL in the
body of the message. The app passes the csv file as raw HTTP POST data
(not a multipart form!), and expects English text in return. The text should
be a description of the analysis in text/plain format that will be
voiced by the assistant device. If the user invokes the analyze
command with a column #, that # will be passed to the webhook as a
“column” variable in the QUERY_STRING field. The default webhook
for analyzing csv data is posted on the
<a href="https://github.com/glmck13/VitalSigns/blob/master/analyze.cgi">
Vital Signs github site</a>.</p>
<p class="western">Lastly, in some cases a user might want to replace
the csv file that’s stored under their system account with a
different version. This can be done by sending an email to
welbydx@gmail.com with the word “data” somewhere in the subject
line, and the new csv contents in the body of the message.</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="PRIVACY_STATEMENT"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc119_562478963"></a><a name="__RefHeading___Toc119_1211803896"></a>
PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
<p class="western">This privacy notice applies to both the Vital
Signs Alexa skill and Google action. In general it covers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western">What personally identifiable information
	(PII) is collected while using the skill/action, how it is used, and
	with whom it is shared.</p>
	<li><p class="western">The security controls in place to protect
	your information.</p>
	<li><p class="western">How you can administer your information.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Information Collection &amp; Sharing 
</h2>
<p class="western">Vital Signs is intended for personal use. The
information you share with the tool – your first name, email
address, and vital sign data – is not sold or shared with any other
public or private entity. Only you, your designated proxies, and
myself (as system administrator) have access to the data.</p>
<h2 class="western">Information Security Controls</h2>
<p class="western">A variety of security controls have been
implemented to protect your data:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western">Your vital sign information is stored on a
	virtual private server (VPS) that is physically hosted and secured
	by Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
	<li><p class="western">The Vital Signs account on the VPS is locked
	down so it is only accessible to the system administrator (me).</p>
	<li><p class="western">Your name and email address are stored as
	clear text on the server, but your vital sign history file is
	encrypted on disk using the Linux <a href="http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/">ccrypt</a>
	utility. The encryption key is not stored locally, but is passed to
	the server by the skill/action.</p>
	<li><p class="western">Whenever your data is transmitted across a
	network (e.g. during HTTP and SMTP sessions), it is encrypted using
	TLS.</p>
	<li><p class="western">The tool uses gmail to send/receive email.
	All email folders associated with the administrator account are
	purged daily.</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Managing Your Data</h2>
<p class="western">If at any time you’d like to remove your
information from the system, simply ask the skill/action to erase
your data, which removes just your history file, or to delete your
account, which removes everything about you: your name, email
address, and vital sign history.</p>
<h2 class="western">What about HIPAA?</h2>
<p class="western">It’s worth saying a word about HIPAA. HIPAA
stands for the “Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act”. It’s a law passed back in 1996 that mandates certain data
privacy and security provisions to safeguard medical information.
Does HIPAA apply to information that a patient submits to a health
app like Vital Signs, and if so, how? Thankfully, the Department of
Health and Human services has already considered this scenario, and
<a href="https://hipaaqsportal.hhs.gov/community-library/accounts/92/925889/Public/OCR-health-app-developer-scenarios-2-2016.pdf" target="_blank">published
guidelines on their website</a> to assist app developers. According
to those guidelines, Vital Signs is not subject to HIPAA regulations.
Here’s an excerpt from the guidelines:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.49in">Scenario:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.98in">Consumer downloads a
health app to her smartphone. She populates it with her own
information. For example, the consumer inputs blood glucose levels
and blood pressure readings she obtained herself using home health
equipment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.49in">Based on the Facts
Presented in the Scenario, Is App Developer a HIPAA Business
Associate?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.98in">No. Developer is not
creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health
information (PHI) on behalf of a covered entity or another business
associate. The consumer is using the developer’s app to help her
manage and organize her information without any involvement of her
health care providers.</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc128_3748293789"></a>FEEDBACK</h1>
<p class="western">I’d very much welcome feedback on the tool. Feel
free to email me your comments at <a href="mailto:welbydx@gmail.com">welbydx@gmail.com</a>.
